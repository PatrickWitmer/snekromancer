## Step 1: Building Rubick's Spellbook

For our practice today, let’s:

Create a spellbook with a few sample spells (as Python functions).

Allow Rubick to copy any spell and store it in his spell inventory.

Allow Rubick to cast the copied spell whenever he wants.

## Example gameplay

steal_spell('Fireball')
cast_stolen_spell(0) # Cast Fireball
check_mana()

## Step 2: Gamification Tasks

Steal your first spell and cast it. Gain experience for casting and watch Rubick level up.

Track your mana to make sure you don’t run out while casting.
Level up after casting spells to unlock more powerful spells as Rubick progresses.

Add new spells to your enemy's spellbook as you level up.

### Victory Conditions:

Badge 1: Arcane Apprentice (Copy and cast your first spell)

Badge 2: Mana Master (Cast a spell when Rubick’s mana is critically low)

Badge 3: Archmage (Level up Rubick to at least level 2)
